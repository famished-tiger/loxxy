### Loxxy Test Suite
The test suite is split two parts:  
- The `baseline` folder contains spec files using Lox source files from the "official" Lox implementation
- The `extra` folder contains spec files for additional tests or for testing `Loxxy`-specific features

### To run the test suite...
- Go to the parent directory (i.e. `test_suite`)
- launch `rspec` with the command line:
```
	$ rspec
```
